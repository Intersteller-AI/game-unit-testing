# How to Write Unit Tests in React

This tutorial will guide you through writing unit tests in React using Jest and React Testing Library. By the end, you'll be able to test components, simulate user interactions, test state updates, and make API calls.

## Introduction

When building a website, it's crucial to ensure that each unit of your code works as expected. Unit tests help you achieve this by comparing the expected output with the actual output of your code.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of writing unit tests for React components. We'll use Jest and React Testing Library, which come pre-installed with create-react-app.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new React app using create-react-app. Jest and React Testing Library are included by default. Ensure you have the following lines in your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "react-scripts test --watchAll --coverage"
}
```

## Writing Your First Test

We'll start with a basic test for a simple component that renders an `<h2>` element. Create a new file named `FirstTest.jsx`:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import FirstTest from '../components/FirstTest';

test("Example 1 renders successfully", () => {
    render(<FirstTest/>);

    const element = screen.getByText(/first test/i);

    expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```

## Testing with Mock Data

Next, we'll test a component that displays a list of items. We'll pass mock data as a prop to the component and test if the list renders correctly:

```jsx
// Mock data
const mockData = [
    { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
    { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
    { id: 3, name: "Charlie" }
];

// Test
test("List renders successfully", () => {
    render(<TestWithMockData data={mockData} />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/alice/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```

## Testing User Interactions

Testing user interactions is crucial. For example, we can test if a button click toggles the visibility of a text:

```jsx
test("Toggle text visibility", async () => {
    render(<ToggleText />)
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText(/toggle text/i));
    expect(screen.getByText(/text visible/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```

## Testing State Updates

State updates are a common part of React components. We can test if a component behaves as expected after a state update:

```jsx
test("Page load", () => {
    render(<PageLoad />)
    expect(screen.getByText(/page loaded/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
})
```

## Testing API Calls

Finally, we'll test a component that makes an API call to fetch data. We'll mock the API call and test if the data is rendered correctly:

```jsx
// Mock API call
const mockFetchData = jest.spyOn(services, 'FetchData')
    .mockImplementation(async () => [{ name: 'Alice' }]);

// Test
test("Fetch data from API", async () => {
    render(<APICall />)
    expect(mockFetchData).toHaveBeenCalled();

    await waitFor(() => {
        expect(screen.getByText(/alice/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    })
})
```

## Conclusion

Unit testing is essential for ensuring your React components work as expected. With Jest and React Testing Library, you can easily write and run tests for your components, user interactions, state updates, and API calls.
